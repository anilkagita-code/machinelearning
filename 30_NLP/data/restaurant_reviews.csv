Beautiful decor and well lit.They bring to Hyderabad the concept of Chimney cones were you can enjoy a hot fill or a cold fill in a freshly baked chimney. They do have regular burgers, pizza, sandwiches on their menu too.We ordered for a chicken sandwich, cappuccino and a cold fill peanut butter chimney cone.Sandwich and coffee were good but the chimney cone is something that I thought looked better then how it tasted. It was a straight up thick cone layered with peanut butter filled with vanilla ice cream. The chimney cones are way too thick and has a hole in the bottom making it really inconvenient and messy to eat.Overall a good place to hangout and give the chimney cones a try and see if you like it, the service was good and the staff friendly.cooktravelrepeat.com"

The spread was excellent, far too many dishes for one man to taste. I loved the roast chicken, pork stew & the steak & eggs. Cold cuts were also good, but choice was limited. Pizza & sushi were kind of a letdown though. The live grill was quite good, though the chef over cooked the marinated tenderloins (partly my fault, since I forgot to tell him to cook it medium rare, but then again a professional chef should by default not cook steak above medium readiness). Desserts were good, but I felt they need to diversify their dessert spread, which was too focussed on multi-tier cakes. As for the drinks, I enjoyed the Whiskey Sour. Overall I felt that while the large spread is commendable, more care needs to be taken to perfect each offering."

Well, it seemed like a nice place till we actually got there. We were not even allowed inside because apparently they have a very strict dress code. All of us were in semi formals as we went to the place straight from the work — so we were not exactly inappropriately dressed. The only thing missing were shoes. Some of us were wearing flip flops. We were asked to leave as we were not wearing shoes - or at least that is what we were told. Seems like people are being judged by their footwear there days! It’s a brewery — people go there to chill out. I found this behaviour to be highly unprofessional and downright insulting.Rest assured, I’ll not visit this place, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone.Recommendation: A strict NO!"

The service was a lil slow but its understandable as the place was buzzing.The food was average and the pricing is on higher side.The reason for my low rating is because at the time of billing we noticed that they levy 10% service charge which I assumed it should be optional so I asked the staff to deduct it.And then the manager appeared stating the reason why they levy service charge as this is a new place etc. and gave us a dirty look when we asked is it mandatory the grudgingly deducted it.I didn't expect such a behaviour from the manager.Before visiting I was mesmerized with the ambiance in the pictures but now idk if its worth it."

We reached a little early so there weren’t many people. The service was terrible. The wait staff is not trained well. They were preparing for a band to play that evening and kept hammering things around us. Did not care if we wanted anything else. The food was ok and the drinks were pretty great but that I could get at any other pub. The experience was terrible and I would not come back.

And that expectations were the reasons of disappointment. The ambience was pretty decent and the music was too apt for the ambience. For the surprise they did not have any special night for the special occasion. The pub got closed by 11.30 PM which turns out to be one more disappointment. The food taste is quite ok but the service is what makes it special. Though that service will make a very very big hole in your pocket. The place is too costly when compared to its peers or competitions. An advice : Go to this place only on weekends and that too when you can shelve extra amount. Half of the drinks are not available there. Rest the place though has capability to make an evening.

The pub is also streched on a big scale with a rectangular bar counter in the middle.Coming to food and drinks, there is lot of variety on the menu from starters to the main course.Must try outs are avacado cones. They were delicious. Prawns chilly, reshmi kebab, maggie cheeseballs are best among the starters.In drinks menu mocktails are overwhelming. Pinacolada is the best among cocktails.The ambience is super Amazing here. The dj will make you groove to your feet. Most recommended"

Their risotto too was amazing, rich and thick like a risotto should be (the only flaw was the fact that they thought we had ordered for seafood risotto but we had actually ordered for the wild mushroom one. So in a hurry to prepare for it, the rice were a bit uncooked). We truly enjoyed the authentic flavours of Italian food and also their Tiramisu is a must must have.

What I really liked about the place was that the staff gives you space, unlike others where they are nosey and pushing you to give order. The issue what i faced was with the lights. Lights is a major thing that creates the ambience. It probably created the mood but not bright enough for me to be able to read the menu. Also, I way the menu card was designed, did not impress me. Either the colours should be such that one is able to read in dim lights as well. But regardless, overall experience was really good."

To be honest, I was let down. Draught beer on the menu was not available. Which makes you choose from other list where KF was again not available. To me this feels like strategies around new year to make customers buy into different costly products. Apart from drink we ordered burger and a pizza. Burger was small with a tiny salad serving and countable french fries. I am not a fan of slippery slope burger. It didnt match up to its name - hot and spicy. It was plain cheese (with very slight tinge of cheddar) and chicken patty that was neither hot or spicy. For the price, not worth it. Similarly, the pizza was with no trace of cheddar, and very thinly sliced mushroom toppings. So thin that i can safely assume it was one mushroom for thr entire pizza.Ambience did not appeal to me to the name. However I liked the music being played.

We were stuck with high table that were quite uncomfortable for us. However we still managed to eat are food and drink there.My friend ordered a stuffed roasted chicken with jus on the side accompanied by a detox juice which had mixed fruit and veggies. I had a creamy chicken ravioli in white sauce accompanied by a pina colada. We thoroughly enjoyed are food and drinks.The detox juice did not seem to be fresh and tasted artificial.Overall a must visit while you are in Hyderabad for sure. The best time to visit is in the evening or afternoon during the weekdays as it gets crowded on the weekends.

At a nominal price of 200 it sets the tone for the orders to come without disappointment. And the jalapeño cheese balls were a perfect addition to the table. Further we ordered the chilly baby corn that wasn’t much appreciated but you could try other options. Since we went late and their kitchen was closed, we ordered falafel and pita bread that was light and just fine. The icing on the cake was the molecular signature cocktail with a tinge of spices and whiskey.

However It's a task to get your dish at this place since there's always a huge crowd at this place and very limited employees which is kind of a set back for this place . They certainly need to increase their staff . However their existing staff although small in number are yet very quick .

It has really good food ,amazing ambiance and absolutely beautiful views.I tried 3 things1. Pasta Aglio e Olio - For a dry past it had the required punch of spice.2. Pizza Bolognese - It was a super cheesy pizza in which you could still taste everything else as well.3. Cold Coffee - This is something they need to improve on. Slightly diluted and more water based for my preference.Note that even though the name says a bar this place does not serve alcohol YET."

With a bit difficulty I managed to find a table and ordered french fries masala which was hot, crisp and masaledar to the perfection. Corn cheese naught was good but portion of corn was limited. Niloufer special tea had nothing special though, but they do serve it but different. Look for the pic. Honey finger cake was good but not value for money. Roat biscuit was very much upto my liking and is must try.I gave one 🌟 less as there was no adequate parking space, quality of tea and over pricing of cake.Based on the first day's impression I visited the cafe again. Cold coffe was not at all value for money, pizza was ok ok. Osmania biscuit is just wow."

What has not deteriorated however is the quality of food. For folks craving asli Punjabi khaana...head out to the Dhaba. Might need some reservation as the place is not huge and weekends could see some crazy rush. Tip, do not miss out on the kulfi and the phirni at this place post the meal.

The place can be easily spotted with about 50+ people waiting outside in a queue leading up to the restaurant at 1st floor which has a capacity of 100 people. Coming to the food, as it's a mess there's just meals in vegetarian that you order. In meals the fry was of potatoes along with tomato pappu or dal and sambar and rasam. The fry was great, pappu was also authentic and tasty. The sambar and rasam too were upto the mark, the rice is served hot and there is a bowl of ghee and podi to accompany. Also as in all thalis, a appalam not much oily is served along with sweet. The best thing on the day of visit was the curd that was amazingly fresh and tasty.

Right from the starters to the desserts they have maintained the taste and quality of every dish.A few dishes may taste a little Indian but that just helps you to find a tiny change from the cheesy taste in everything.Botj veg and non veg starters were good. The complimentary mocktail was also nice. Do not miss the pizza and the pasta! I totally loved the one in mixed sauce. They will customise it according to your preferred toppings also.Delicious!!I was so full by this time that i cudnt eat much of main course.But i tried a spoon of all the items and liked then overall. The only thing i didn't like were the salads.Choco fudge in the dessert section was yummm!!The 2 varieties of ice cream were also tasty.I have become a fan of this place.But again, if you like Indian more...then better not to go for the buffet.For people like me..who love Italian..this is a must east place :)"

The starters are beetroot tikka, paneer starter and jalapeno poppers.Beetroot tikka was just ok, paneer starter was good and poppers was outstanding. Breads and dips were ok. Deserts and main course are also just ok. The deserts that got finished were not refilled. Overall impression is that the spread and taste of the buffet does not suit the price they charged."

I visited here only for the food, where we ordered the ‘Bhut Jholakia hot wings’ which tasted great but were extremely spicy at the same time (Bhut Jholakia is a red chilli and is the most spiciest of all available varieties). After which we ordered the Four Cheese pizza and the Margerita Pizza which were a little bland to my liking, but then I think it was because of the chicken wings. Moving forward, we ordered Cheese Nachos and Peri-Peri Fries which were good too.If we talk about the ambience, It feels like a brewery (obviously) but if you’re a teetotaller, you might find this place claustrophobic (like I did). Also, the menu is definitely towards the expensive side and the drinks, I’m not sure about comparing their prices.Overall, it was a good experience considering the food and snacks!"

The ambiance is lovely with great seating arrangement and amazing lighting.I had an absolute black, a white Nutella with chocolate hazelnut wafers and a dark forest which costed me a total of rs. 661.All the flavours were superb and I had absolutely no complaints with the service as well. Amazing parlour and an extraordinary experience. Highly recommended."

However they have a decent variety to choose from and the texture and taste of ice cream is great. The cones are also tasteful and has dark chocolate towards the end of it. People who are not fond of dark chocolates might not like it. They has creative flavours like whiskey cream and white Nutella and they were all yum.The service was also very prompt and the staff very professional yet friendly. Ambience is cozy and simple. Nice place to be and the serving is worth the money. One serving is 2 scoops.

This place surely is an underdog given the hidden location and less exposure to crowd. I myself have seen this place numerous times on my way to office but never entered due to the odd times I travel on that route. I have decided one fine day to visit the store and oh boy, I regret for not visiting this store any before. The taste, texture and richness that their Gelatos carry is excellent. They keep changing the flavors every week so that the customers who come in regularly won't feel bored. Trust me, once you visit this place, you will surely visit again. I have tasted quite a few but had to pick only one as I was not so hungry. I chose brownie gelato and as I said these were tastiest and flavorful best.Do try, if you haven't tried yet and you would agree with me."
