Review,Star
"This is my 1st ever Echo ü•∫ I'm amazed by its capabilities, however I still do not feel any necessities of it.""The more you want to be dependent, you become dependent""It's really an impulsive purchase üòÄ. But still you should experience echo devices at least once. Just to experience the technology. In many things it is useful, like asking questions, weather, alarm, news etc.Now its pros:1. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è the design.2. Has a good weight.3. Sturdy built.4. Good bass for such a 1.6"" driver.5. Highs with just 0.8"" tweeter is adding unbelievable clarity to the sound.6.  Can easily pair to the Alexa app.7. Priced moderately.8. You can make connections to smart plug and smart bulbs easily.9. Can play apple music if u hv subscription.10. Auto pairing after light cuts.11. Excellent sound quality for its wize üëç12. 5 feet power adaptor cable13. Has Line out 3.5mm for connecting external speakers or ht.Cons:1. Need a continuous power.2. Need a continuous wifi connection.Colors: black, white and blue. Black one gives you more contrast against its bottom lighting ring. Black doesn't get dirty easily. Gives a distinct look.That's about it friends! Ask me if you have any questions.",4.4
"Excellent product, super quality. It capable to play audible audio books and it reads kindle e books also, I am wandering about reading capable of reading kindle books. I am enjoying.",5
"So it is my first Echo Dot.It definitely looks good. I like its spherical shape as compared to Ice hockey shape of last gen.Setting up hardly takes a minute.Sound quality is nothing impressive.Loudness is good enough but bass response is too low. Even lower than my 5watt JBL speaker which is definitely a let down. However bass can be increased but make sure with bass you also increase mids n high a bit so that the bass doesn't overpower the vocals n instruments.It is quite responsive in taking commands but at times it does not respond even if I shout and that too when the speaker is the same room as I am. It appears that it goes on sleep mode when not in use for quite a while. Not a deal breaker but it can be a nuisance clicking the mute or voice recognition button just to ""wake"" it up.Overall I am fine the product. As a new user, I do not mind it however I feel like bigger echo will definitely be the best if money is not an issue.But yes for an entry level smart speaker it is amazing n definitely worth the price.",2
I was expecting more as it's 4th gen... But disappointed as nothing new as all things r same as 3rd gen..Even AUX IN Not supported. Light ring also not much visible at lower level.. Lots of design fault one can experience when use... Buttons also feels like cheap Bluetooth speakers.Audio quality seems same as 3rd gen.. I was expecting better sound quality as size increased.. At least more Bass can added... Very disappointedüòû.. AUX IN is much needed n expected. I m keeing it as got in deal price..,5
Love the new revamped version of Alexa.  All you need to do is configure the devices via Alexa app and your good to go.Sound is definitely better than 3rd gen echo dot.Bass is better than previous gen(Increase bass to full via Alexa app to enjoy).Easy to connect other smart home appliances.Pro-Good sound quality and bass.Mic sound reception is goodCon-Feels little bulkyNot so portable as it needs continues powersupply.,5
The sound quality is not that good. Especially the bass quality is very low. In the discription of the product it was mentioned that the bass quality has been improved compaired to older generations but it is not true. Paid more money for nothing.,5
"Love the new revamped version of Alexa. Connected all my smart devices like Bulb, TV, Playstation etc. Everything is working seamlessly. All you need to do is configure the devices via Alexa app and your good to go.Sound is slightly better than previous version but if your coming from 3rd Gen you won't notice that much. For more deeper and rich experience i would say go for higher model and also at this point since it is a very new devices i can see sometimes the device didn't respond but i believe that will be fixed with software updates.",5
"Prebooked it, haven't received it yet whereas other's who have booked after launch received one airway. I see now there are many other frustrated customers who have left similar comments. I was expecting by Friday, but now delivery date says Monday.Regarding the product itself, you can also read/watch other reviews - this is basically a redesign of 3rd gen echo dot, looks better (in my opinion) and sounds slightly clearer. If you want better sound go for the larger echo or invest in a good Bluetooth speaker and use this only for Alexa capabilities. The Alexa app couldn't detect the Wipro smart bulb (that's sold as a combo) in the first attempt, it takes a to couple of steps if you know what you are doing.",4
"It has sleep mode or listening problem.Sometimes it doesn't listen even if you kerp shouting its name. Maybe it enters sleep mode or something. It's a problem with get 4 only i believe as the old echo in my other room listen my voice when i am shouting in fron of this one. I believe an update might resolve it but i have chosen to return. When it stops responding, press its button and it starts responding fine, maybe that button press brings it out of sleep, but that shouldn't be the caee, the word Alexa should be able to bring it iut of sleep.Otherwise, sound is ok, looks are good, looks durable, can control smart lights. Aux out is good, you can attach to other bluetooth speakers, in that case the sound will come from that soeaker, i connected it to Marshall. It came already attached to my account, so no installation hastle, but uts easy to manage from your alexa app in mobile phone.It's a good thing to have st home, other than the sleep issue many of us are facing wirh this gen.Read somewhere that enabling Spotify can disable that power save sleep mode, if successful, then its s good buy.Sound is ok for one room, its clear with dome ok beat and treble, you can change equilizer settings in app or by voice command also.And when it's not in sleep power save mode, the mic is good even in loud musice the mic is responsive when not in power save sleep mode.",2
"This review is going to be different. As most of you by now would know it is a great device and so forth. However, I had to return the device due to its software glitch. It becomes unresponsive. Most of you might not experience this. Here is why. Most of the people will be happy with its decent speaker output and these group of people are not going to face this issue. But,  for the folks who would look for extra base and sound quality are going to suffer because they are going to connect this with external bluetooth speaker. :)This is my second Echo Dot 4th Gen and it still has the issue. So after spending sometime with the second device I finally found the cause and the solution. It happens when I pair with external bluetooth speaker. It becomes unresponsive while it is disconnected from bluetooth speaker. To make it work you have to switch to the paired bluetooth speaker or press the mute button and unmute again from the deviceNow you might be thinking why do we have to do all that, it might work by simply unpairing the device. I am sorry it doesn't work even if you unpair/delete the device.Currently the only solution is to 'factory reset' (by pressing and holding the action button for 25 sec) and do a fresh setup. PLEASE DO NOT PAIR WITH ANY BLUETOOTH speaker. I used this without pairing with BT speaker for two days and it works great without any issues.I am going to return this device.I hope Echo team knows this issue and they fix it by releasing a software update.",5

  ¬†Not responding after few minutes. Even if I speak within 30cm range. I have to press mute and unmute again to make it work. Have to return.",1
"Sound is Okay not WowAI needs a lot of improvementI would say, not worth at this price point",5
Alexa is recording everything spoken at home and uploading to Amazon servers and then suggesting  what ig thinks you need to buy through the app. This is severe violation of personal privacy and illegalInchu of Amazon customer  care 1424H is in denial and defending  the indefensible. Wonder what the public think of Amazons illegal invasion of personal space like this,5
It‚Äôs just awesome.üëçüòç I thought dot is bit small so the sound quality may affect due to size but really it‚Äôs really a beast. The sound system is just beyond my expectations in one room the sound to the full volume is very loud.,1
Sound output comes as if ur listening from JBL 320watt speakers with woofer.Loud enough for 15 feet roomEasy to setup via alexa App on ur smaet phoneBest part is it recognises and responds much faster than human now. It can respond from 8 to 10feet as wellExcellent build quality!!My kids use this a Teacher asking questions related GK /Math & Science to know more about the subject andI use it to play fm and music etcOverall a great product with xcellent features.It would have been good if they added a battery back up option as it powers down during electricity failure.Dont hesitate..just buy and see the fun.This has become a new family member and needs respect 24√ó7.,1
"I initially ordered the puck ball Alexa, the third generation one. I was not sure (like my kindle, or JBL flip etc) if I had a proper use case for it. It came, though the sound was feebler than this Alexa, I found it to be useful- it can keep reminder for me, set up alarms, can play songs while i work, and can crack occasional bad jokes to laugh at. My wife uses it to find out recipes, and news is another good thing. For the sake of nostalgia, i also listen to Vividh Bharati (All India Radio) on it. It is an absolute treat- a darling.Since I have a variety of speakers, and headphones, I can compare the latest 4th generation Alexa:Sound quality:It's a mono speaker, so do not expect the quality of Herman Kardon, Bose, B&O, etc. However, in the Alexa dot sub family, it has a better sound than previous Alexa's. The advantage here is that the speakers are upward firing, and are 1.6 inches in diameter, instead of 1.1 inches in 3rd generation, where they were downwards. Volume wise- it has a better volume than the 3rd generation one. Compared to JBL Flip, its max volume stands lesser though. But this is good to fill a room 30 feet by 30 feet, is my observation.Ease of use: Alexa now has a neural chip. What this means, in lay terms is that some preprocessing of your voice will happen here itself on Alexa, and will be sent to server as a simpler request to resolve into action. The server will find simpler instruction easier to solve, and hence saves time.In reality, the neural chip takes some time to get accustomed to your voice, pronunciation, and accent. After initial few days (about 2-3 days, so keep patience), it begins to understand your utterances better than Alexa 3rd gen.The bass, treble, and middle can be adjusted though the app (an equalizer is given in the settings of Alexa app).There are a lot of apps for music, news, and other things, and the sound is crystal clear.Build:This one has internal chassis made up of aluminum, so it is sturdier than its predecessors- Alexa 3rd gen. As a cost of being stronger, it is a bit heavy, but by 200 grams, so I will not whine about it.Design:The hockey puck shape was beautiful in my opinion, but even this shape is good too. However, the light is at the base, so it can not be seen while lying on bed, and if the alexa is at a higher altitude than you. I felt, that if they put the light slanted, along the edge of cloth and plastic, it would be visible form all angles, and it would look eccentrically beautiful, but to each his own. No complaints here too.Smart home:It can integrate wide varieties of smart bulbs, switches etc seamlessly. This has caused me to buy 3 bulbs, and 1 switch to integrate with it. Using the ""routines"" section in setting allows me to set up the lights, volume of alexa etc according to the time of the day. this has cause a sort of automatic switching in my home. (I found philips bulbs far better than Wipro bulb which came with this Alexa).Online shopping:Amazon encourages the buying through Alexa, but I find it too much of a risque. I don't want to order things in a jiffy, instead, i plan, research, and then buy. So I will not comment anything there.Cons of Alexa:1. No battery: it would be good if we could carry this geodesic piece of beauty along, from room to room. Only if we could.2. Wire colour: Wire is only colored white, which does not match with other colours of Alexa like Black and Blue. This is more about aesthetics than function of it.3. No Micro USB: The charger has a proprietary pin, hence regular chargers do not fit.4. It should buffer the song it is playing, so that the whole song is free from internet disruption. Hence, repeating the song will also be independent of internet.5. Sound quality: just ok, but it can be compensated by attaching it to a good speaker like JBL Flip, Bose etc.Summary, I am finding it as a handy instrument to set up timers, alarms, reminders (I am usually busy at work), songs etc. So there are uses which I am cool about. It has somehow, replaced the use of tablet and JBL to play the songs.",2
"Disappointed by the pre-booking. I was under the impression that priority will given to them on delivery but that's not how it's happening. For the same location delivery is available for the next day, for the same price and offer ! Even after assurances from customer care, the date of delivery has been further shifted to 1st November !! This is totally ridiculous, never expected this from Amazon. Would definitely never do a pre-order.",4.4
"It's just wonderful . please go through my YouTube channel SuAni Tech for the unboxing of this latest gadget All-new Alexa Echo For, thanks Amazon for good service ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Love the design of the new echo dot (my primary reason for buying it). As of now, I don't see a huge difference between 2nd generation and this one.",2
"Thanks to google that I reviewed the products well and did not go for 3rd gen.This 4th gen product has a better chip for voice processing.It is faster, correct and also clear. I have tested it from 10 feet once and Alexa correctly understood the command.Once we checked from another room (note that there was a solid wall between me and Alexa) - then also she played songs. So 5* for the mic and 5* for processing the commands.I also connected it with smart devices like bulb and switches. Alexa processes every command clearly.",1
I have learned from this purchase that never prebook anything on Amazon. I ordered it on 19th October and it stated estimated delivery date of 23rd to 31st October. So i thought it shal get delivered by 24th or 25th October max but now it is showing 31st October. Whereas people who bought it after the launch date got it delivered in one day. And if i am looking to order now it is showing max 2 days of delivery time. Pathetic service from Amazon. Never ever prebook anything from Amazon.,1
Doesn't listen properly... Echodot 3 is best alexa.. for alexa Echodot 3 üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,1
Happy with the purchase. 4th generation echo dot has improved sound and I can notice the difference as my neighbours have echo dot 3 which is not that loud. I.also have Google Home hub but I like this 4th gen device sound. Crisp clear.I find it frustrating that you cannot play wynk music or YouTube directly with Alexa voice commands. That is the only downside.,1
Guys uve just done good Marketing but forgot to put good brains in the equipment.  Had u invested even an extra in creating a good AI it would have created wonders. So in nutshell Amazon is just trying to fool us with another junk. It cant understand anything's more than the weather report. Playing your playlist with JioSaavan is like crime..it just cant understand a bit..goes on playing whatever it wants irrespective of what you ask for. Amazon seems to have some rivalry with Google the most simple commands that Google does best was simply required to be integrated but it seems Alexa has been configured not to check anything on Google resultant in an extremely irritating n irrelevant feedbacks the device gives.Please grow up improve the playlist integration improve your search engines without reinventing the wheel. For heavens sake talk to it yourself n ull get the answer. Guys if you want to bang your head daily against an idiot buy this. It's just a refined Bluetooth speaker. Thts it..,5
The sound quality is best but bass is a bit ok ok but definately improved from previous generation. And most of them said that they had delivery issues even after preorder but I didn't face any issues even after preordering one day before the launch I recieved it one day after the launch. If you want to upgrade your 3rd generation to 4th generation then it will be worth it.,5
"The seal on the box was half broken but the product was ok till now , i placed the it for replacement but still in processVery disappointing, from the seal it looked like it was opened before.",5
It's worth of money .great prouct .major improments and design change over then 3 rd genartion .4 th genration alexa rating i giving to 9/10,5
Good but not great product. Disconnects frequently when connected to my laptop when using it as a speaker. Louder sounds but miss quality output. Like many other customers even I noticed that preordered customers received this product late and those who ordered post launch received it in just 1 or 2 days,1
Amazing smart speaker great sound I don't know why people saying it's just 3rd gen with spherical shape but the reality is that it's an upgrade over 3rd gen it's quite louder than 3rd gen with more bass I used 3rd gen on volume 6 and it gives much better experience at volume 4 so don't go for hate comments it's actually good got in sale for ‚Çπ3250 which is reasonable price,5
The sound is pretty low. I‚Äôd suggest to go for  echo dot 3 instead which is more powerful. Really expected too much from this device and I‚Äôm disappointed.,5
Good device but in-build skills are quite limited and skill available on alexa app are majorly for US customer. Amazon should bring more skills helpful for Indian users. They should also consider making the product in India rather than China as it will make customer feels more secure about their data.Preorder policy is not good as preorder product takes week to deliver and non-preorder delivers next day.,5
"My review comment.1. It's doesn't turn on the  normal FM.2. IF you are listening to high volume song and you want to stop by saying Alexa, it doesnt listen you have to keep on shouting loud.3. Sound is not that Great.",5
"Friends, got this Alexa model from Amazon online and started using since yesterday evening.Very awesome and amazing experience.Superb performance and I felt missing Alexa all these years. Anyhow better late than never.Most of you may be already using but as I do not know till date, I felt I missed a lot.In fact it is a true companion for all age groups.Those who want to try, I recommend 1000% üòäüòäüòä",4.4
There is no battery in this device....  How can I carry it.... What made the product designers to not give battery,5
"This is amazing product of amazon. The sound quality is the best. Also it's super smart, if you asked her perfect question. This new echo dot 4th generation arrived on dusshera so it's so special for us all. We are super satisfied and happy. Also the shape is so cute. She is most obedient kid of our house, listens to everything and everyone. If you are thinking to buy it, then please go for it, amazon won't Dissapoint anyone and personally trust amazon for each and every product üëçüëå‚ú®",2
"I searched for some telugu songs and English music on this device. It searched 50% correct item.but most of the times it says this song not available in music library.. after that I searched same song or album in gaana,hangama ,jio sa van, amazon music ...Etc..Which is alaa searching libraries.... that song or album avaible in all above music library which are the search engines for alaxa divice.Second one is you control with alaxa in your home devices if  that all devices must be smart devices.The third one is the alaxa divide not built in  battery.Forth one is google have better search engine.It's ok ...",1
"I have been using Alexa for past few days and here is my reviewPositives:Sound quality - Mind blowing and good quality toocan act as Bluetooth speaker if you connect from other devices. ( I connect it for calls from PC)Mic/Call quality - fire fire fireAlexa's understanding even at full volumeRelly good for basic tasks, news reading etc.,Negatives:No Spotify supportPoor Regional support(not up to the mark for the south Indian music/carnatic/film etcs)Not as friendly as Google assist/Siri w.r.t to regional trends",3
"This is just a life changing thing. Being an audiophile, it is very rare for me to overlook sound quality for an audio device but damn is this one good exception. This device just plays music in the most accessible way I've ever experienced. The first experience of just giving a voice command to play the song you want to hear while you are engaged with something else, is just life changing. No longer do I have to interact with my phone, connect my headphones and then listen to the song after searching for it. This device just takes out the friction of the music listening experience which is present on traditional devices.The smart features are pretty amazing too. Well, that's the bread and butter of this device so that was pretty much expected, and this device did deliver. The ""Skills"" and ""Routines"" in particular are very good features and just expand this device's capabilities as a smart home hub exponentially.Coming the the sound quality, I would say it is okay at best. The highs are decent and the mids are very clear but the low end is sub-par. The maximum volume level is acceptable and the audio does not distort much at the highest volume. Also, the mics on this thing are amazing. Overall, I would say that the sound quality is acceptable at least. The sound is not very tiny and is apt for casual music listening sessions, or just having some background music on.On top of it all it is also a very good ""toy"" for the elders and kids alike. I find my parents asking random and hilarious questions to Alexa and it is just a great side benefit.So, to sum this review up, the Echo Dot is one hell of a device, and is a great buy regardless of your intended use. This is just great!",5
"I have purchased 4th Generation Eco launched on 22-October and nice that I received it same day.Has used older version as well, but can't locate the difference between 3rd and 4th Generation(other than hardware design).Overall a nice product.",5
SoundIt is a bit louder than previous echo dots. But loses out on sound clarity. Sound seems muffled and distant with no treble and mid range.ResponsivenessSomehow I feel this generation is flawed. It just does not respond to the wake up word. I bought an Echo Dot. Then had it exchanged because it just stopped responding to the wake up word Alexa. The new one seems just as bad. The first generation could hear the word even when music was playing loudly on auxiliary speakers. This generation is pathetic in comparison.Not worth the money.,1
"I bought this echo dot to use it as a voice monitor fot my 7months old babyThe dropin feature in acho dot helps to hear the sounds in the baby room via mobile phone,This product is conveniet to play music, alarms  and switchon or off the lights with just a voice comandSound quality is clear and loud enough to fill the roomI like it",5
"Small but powerful speaker. Nice to listen to your favorite Bollywood retro songs or a web radio while cooking in the kitchen.  You can even ask Alexa for recipes, and set a timer to remind you when to stop the microwave. She can tell you the time/date/news headlines or even switch on the oven using an IoT plug. Alexa is also ideal for remembering your shopping list: you can add items to the list, as and when you notice you are running out of some grocery item.",1
"This particular model have some defects, it will not recognize your voice after some time you will keep on shouting alexa-alexa -echo, whatever you have seleceted as a wake word it will simply not respond then you have to press the mic enbale/disable button on the alexa physically then you will be able to give voice commands, sound quality is too poor for this product, bass is decent upto 60-70% volume bit after that all you get is sound like a cheap spekar you can get under 500 bucks. overall design is good but not worthy at this price point. Recommend you to purchase eco dot 3rd gen instead.",5
This is my 1st smart speaker. I settled down with alexa rather than google assistant basically because alexa is more updated with indian content and google assistant not. But if you have android tv n all go for google nest because of compatibility.Product quality is good looks are decent but sound quality is not good. In loud volume base is completely lacking and the audio sounds very weird.The ring ling looks way cooler though than the google nest mini.Alexa app is good. I found it at par with google assistant app. Its just that google is everywhere therefore its assistant is much more integrated everywhere in day to day tasks. But amazon alexa instead is much more accurate in terms of its personality and the response.,3
"I have been using this for only a week, so its my initial impression:Ordered the combo of 4th gen echo dot, firetv stick lite and wipro 9W smart bulb at 4900 with SBI credit card offer.First of all, those features which are not mentioned anywhere:FireTv has its inbuilt bluetooth through which u can connect your echo dot and use it as an external speaker for your TV/Monitor, whichever you are have connected your FireTv stick to. I bought Lite version coz I am using a monitor, power and volume buttons doesn't work on a monitor so no point buying normal FireTv stick. You can control echo dot's volume with Alexa voice vommands even when its connected through bluetooth with fireTv. Bluetooth connection process is very easy, just to to settings in FireTv, remote and bluetooth devices, search for other bluetooth devices, and it will show you Echo dot option.Coming to smart bulb , 9W is ok for a small room, definitely not worth its listed price of 599, but given the price of combo its really a steal!U can control it with echo dot and Wipro app!You can connect google next mini also as bluetooh speaker with FireTv stick but the ecosystem will not be compatible and u won't be able to give commands to your TV or Monitor!If u have prime, life would be easier as Amazon Music is default search for playing music by voice command ( you can select spotify also).Overall good combo pricing. Any bluetooth speaker also would cost around 2 to 3k, and I dont need battery backup for home use, and also speakers with battery builtin last less than normal ones.Overall Its good for Tech enthusiasts who want to taste some nextgen flavour, where IOT devices would be all around us!",5
"Excellent Product.. Absolutely loved it, very responsive and much upgraded than older version",1
"I received the 4th gen echo dot as a gift in February,I am not an extensive user,so it was rarely used. However,just after 2 months in April,it started giving trouble. It would Stop after 10 minutes automatically (the mic switch would function and glow when clicked, which means power supply working fine).It would only work,if I plug it off and then switch it on after sometime.I tried reaching out to Amazon echo customer support,who tried troubleshooting but then informed me it's hardware support and they would replace it.However, the process they asked me to go through is weird in the least. They asked me to place order for a new one, and once its delivered to return the old one in the new one's packaging and I would get the money back once the old one reach them.I did that and currently waiting for my refund as well as hoping that this one would last a little bit more than last 4th Gen.I would like to add here,I have gifted echo 3rd gen to my friends who has been using it regularly for more than a year without any issue of any sort.",4.4
"When ever I try to play a Tamil song, the sound recognition and play was very pathetic. Even when it has to play from my Amazon music playlist it was not upto satisfaction. It has some predefined stations from which it is getting playedIn Amazon Music app, the same voice recognition works awesome.But in Alexa, I don't know it was very bad and it used to play a very different song which became a playful thing for us and it was comical.Also for some reason, there was wifi connectivity issue I think where the song was getting stopped and resumed. May be a software glitch.May be I will give it a try at some point later when I get some good deals.Overall it was not to my satisfaction. Sound was good enough.",5
"the device works as expected, very good sound quality.. since the speakers are forward firing u may experience a bit drop in volume when hearing from side angle..vocals are very clear, enjoying podcasts..during set-up faced issue with selecting region, my account was somehow linked to Amazon US, called up CC and they were able to reset it to India..and now regarding the shipping: absolutely pathetic from Amazon, first thing my order was delayed even after reaching final delivery center, and it was very poorly packed, no kind of cushion given, the device box was fiddling around like crazy.. very poor from Amazon..to my luck the product was not damaged.. but really Amazon needs to pack things properly..",2
Delayed delivery for pre booked and next day delivery for ordering now.This is complete foolishness from amazon.y friend already got it and he placed order just yesterday,1
"Booked on 19th October with delivery date of 23rd October and now it shows 31st october, While many of my friends booked on 22nd October and received within 24hrs, My question is to Amazon management that, How did they deliver the products and everyday delivery date are getting changed. Please explain it, What is the benefits of pre order of product ....... Not happy with amazon ................ Stop making fool to customers please,,,, Do not forget that your business platform is customer based only. So don't try to manipulate with customers ..........",1
"Had some issues with the initial setup but overall, a very well made product. Great speakers with balanced bass, given the size. Alexa response time is also pretty quick. The ring light is quite hard to see from certain lower angles but that shouldn't be a big issue for most people depending on where they place the echo dot.Also, I pre-ordered it, but received it two days after release day so that didn't feel right on the seller's part.",2
It's not that responsive compare to other Eco Dot. Most of the time she is sleeping or else does something else as per her wish. I think the mic is not as required the problem is still after it was replaced by the Amazon. Its still in warranty but I don't think replacing will solve the issue. This is my experience can check some other reviews too,5
Product is wonderful at least it must be mentioned otherwise amazon will not post your review. I pre book it on 16 after paying extra for prime membership. But product not shipped yet.,1
"The audio is just bass heavy and the lows are not that great.Alexa is good but definitely lagging behind google assistant in terms of responding to unique voices.Too many skills in the Alexa app, unfortunately most of them don't work as expected.Needs amazon's effort to consolidate and test these skills then make it available to the public.Falls under the category of ""Skippable"".",5
"I have ordered 4th Generation, but received 3rd Generation.. Very disappointed...",5
"You may confused about looks, Yes it's looks is subject but That big it look in the picture it's not actually that big, and bottom light is stunning, I placed it on my study table over the glass it show cool effect.In can say in terms of LED light it is far better than echo dot 3.Sound quality is not that much rich, but it is balanced which you can listen in long hours.It not necessary but if you can offorrd definitely try it, like whenever you fell bore just play with it.",3
"This is my 1st ever Smart Device , Got it with the SMART Bulb and Fire TV stickAlexa was already there in one of my Bluetooth headphones which i got to know post installing Alexa in my phone to pair this ECHOYou can find plenty of SMART devices in the market, and SMART devices is a growing market and ALEXA and GOOGLE Assistant are the leaders in the Voice Assistant for the SMART DevicesYou can controlLights with voiceMusic with voiceSet AlarmsSet RemindersOrder FoodBook a Caband things are getting added so quickly in this platformPros:1. Design is awesome and when you speak the Ring light glows gives good looks2. Nice Bass3. Sturdy quality.4. Easily pairs with other SMART Devices5. Has buttons to Reduce volume or increase in it as well6. Nominal price7. ALEXA can understand only English and HINDI - more languages will be added in the futureCons:1. Need a continuous power.2. Need a continuous wifi connection.Suggestions :There is no Basic need for this deviceHowever if you want to make your home a smart home - this is a must to have device.",5
"In pictutes it looks a bit bulky, but I found a very cute and compact product after unboxing. Voice recognition is very good and it can recognise me from the other end of the room even with music playing.Sound quality is average, nothing too good. However, you can change the bass, trebble , etc from your Alexa app.I mainly use it for smart home automation, setting timers/reminders, and playing music. My music streaming service if choice is Spotify, and one needs a premium subscription of it to play music from voice. For other services like gaana and Saavn, it may work without subscription.Overall, a good purchase. If you have never owned an echo device before, you can certainly go for this one.",4
The 4th generation echo dot is surely a worthy upgrade from previous ones because of the following reasons-1. Improved Sound Quality2. Deeper Bass3. Enhanced voice response4. Great Build Quality5. Appealing looksüòçIf you are considering to buy a smart speaker then definitely go for it without any doubt. Trust me it's far ahead than competitors.,4
Biggest disappointment is that it needs to be connected to wallcharger for all the time. It doesn't have battery inside to store the power. How come Amazon couldn't figure out the way to provide charging option here? I also experienced long delays from Alexa and it didn't replied to my voice for most of the time.,1
I found this one is way more beautiful than that of previous hockey puck shape. Its underneath light ring reflects on surface beautifully. (Though looks vary from man to man)Sound quality is okay. Vocal is clearer than previous one but bass is noticeably lower.Now I have doubt on my decision of upgrading.If this one is your first one .. go for it..,4.4

  ¬†Pros:1. Best in class sound quality with nice bass2. Mic is good and can listen clearly even we are talking in low voice pitch3. New shape of echo dot is beautiful4. It can understand Hindi language and response is very good and accurate.Cons:1. It does not have connectivity with YouTube music or YouTube (however we can use that from mobile by connecting via Bluetooth to echo dot)2. Does not have inbuilt battery3. Does not capture current location automatically. We need to save it from Amazon alexa app.I will update above list (Pros and cons) after using it for more months",5
"One of the worst variants of their Alexa-enabled devices. I used the 2nd gen. and 3rd gen. as well. After having used the lastest one for over a month, I am disappointed to say it sucks. The device fails to hear the wake up 4/10 times. And suddenly it struck me that the AI remains as dumb as ever, so the upgrade is not worth it at all. If you still need one, I would advise you to go for the previous generation (3rd gen.); it‚Äôs way more responsive and has a decent audio too. I couldn‚Äôt return my device because it was a gift, else such a pathetic ‚ÄúAI‚Äù device shouldn‚Äôt have a place in anyone‚Äôs household.",2

  ¬†Pros :1. Superb sound quality2. Precise voice recognition3. Works flawlessly with other smart devices4. Can use in innovate and unique ways5. Alexa can identify diff√©rent person in home6. Reminders, task to-do etc are life changing7. Black color looks slick and the device feels premium. I love the white minimal adapter with no logoCons:1. Has a very low volume shaky clicking noises while playing old songs with full bass. It's due to movement of the inner parts as the noise levels of some songs mostly old songs are very high. But modern high bass songs work flawlessly as noise is already corrected by music publisher.",5
I use it a lot for reminders and alarms - for work toBe done by kids / their class schedules etcMy kids use it for playing musicMy maid uses it for swatting reminder to switch of motor üòÄSo all in all it‚Äôs become a very useful tool in the houseBut Amazon should expand its music library.. lot of songs still not played by Alexa as it‚Äôs not there in the music library of amazon music,4

"""Amazon means quality""I have many Amazon devices like fire stock kindle and eco. All of them are fabulous if I talk about eco dot 4 gen without a clock which I have I would personally say that it's just awesome it has all the feature as it can control my firestick  2019 HD my Wipro smart bulb also it has a tap to snooze featureI think you should go with eco dot without clock as it has all the feature of the eco dot with clockLike tap to snooze etc, I think spending 1000rs extra just for the clock doesn't make sense and the clock only works when eco is plugged in so I would suggest that if a clock is very very very important than  in 400-500rs you can get very good bedside portable digital clock on Amazon so it's better to go for without clock and purchase a potable clock  (in without clock you can give a command like Alexa what's the time so Alexa will tell you the time)Also, I would suggest Amazon release an echo dot 4 the gen portable with a battery of around 4500-5000rsThank for reading and don't think too must just go for eco dot without a clock",4
What's that lead like ashy smell in the package nowadays with electronics ? Other than that the mic has quite improved but noticed that while playing songs with Bluetooth there's quite a difference in the sound than the sole output from the smart speaker.Wish they can add the ring light as a music visualiserThe forward facing design seems to impact the user if he's sitting directly in front or kept in a corner of room,4
"Good start in home automation. I have attached it with Fire stick 4K + Wipro smart bulb 12V. It has to setup from app n then it works wonders. Bit time consuming ar start, but all worth the efforts at end. U can use it as external bluetooth speaker to fire stick by changing audio setting to ' home theatre' in app only. Nice sound for medium sized room. Large rooms will need external speakers. Loved it.",5
"The seal of the box was not there and also the cardboard was torn from the sides. I wanted to gift this to my senior. PatheticReview 2 - after the above rating ,I immediately got a call from Amazon. They heard my problem and without any fuss, immediately agreed to either refund my money or replace the product. I wanted to gift it to someone and needed it the next day itself, hence they themselves advised me to purchase from Brick and motar shop and refunded my money. 5 star rating to the person who had handled the issue. Though I have been using 2nd generation echo and iam very happy with it.",5
"I'm loving it's performance when compared to Google nest mini both have advantages and disadvantages but I like Alexa more due to its natural voice, drop in feature, Amazon music(prime required), simple set-up, design, physical buttons and many more.In nest mini i like duo calling..",1
I now have both new and prev gen dots. Well both are equally good with newer one slightly improved in responsiveness. Obvious change is appearance which is good but its subjective again. I like both wrt appearances. If u are going for newer one dont go for black color rather go for some other color which is distinctively noticable. BASS IS THE SAME SO PPL WHO ARE LOOKING FOR BETTER BASS WILL GET DISAPPOINTED.,1
The only positive I found is the sound quality and microphone's ability to identify sounds accurately.I need lot more improvements. It is power cord operated and doesn't have a battery inside. I feel like a Bluetooth speaker will be better if Alexa is installed in it.Google assistant is way ahead than alexa. It can speak regional languages with a very better eco system. Alexa's search results are very poor and has a very limited access over the internet.Echo dot couldn't recognise my smart TV connected on the same network. I was manually connecting TV to echodot using bluetooth.I trained my voice to alexa and It recognises all other voices of my family members to be my voice. Alexa gives its good performance on Amazon eco system but has limited oppurtunities to explore cross platforms.,2
"I bought the echo dot(4th gen) around 3-4 days back. So far, it's working great and has provided me a great experience.Pros:-1. Nice look and aesthetics2. A central hub to all of your smart devices3. Very loud and clear voice4. Alexa works very well(even in hindi)Cons:-1. Bass could've been better. So in this price range, I think it's a choice b/w a low-bass smart speaker or a high-bass not-smart speaker.2. Alexa sometimes doesn't get awake when the sound is above 80%. But I think it's reasonable as well.3. If it were operated on battery it would've made it more portable, but again this is understandable.So, to conclude I would say it's a good speaker to have if you are not soo much into music and want to have a smart central controller to have fun with(which I wanted). If you want to have a more bass-heavy sound then you could consider the Echo, that would make more sense.",3
"All good connects bluetooth devices faster thn mobile phone, sound quality is good, but sometimes I hv to raise my voice to get control on Alexa, not able to use youtube, Spotify directly, but I think I need to experiment with thisMy kids enjoy this a lot, helpfull for kids who are learning to speak, better thn watching YT kids and damaging eyes.",3
"The new speaker comes with a slightly better speaker and a very slight(almost negligible) change in voice recognition, but the design (personal opinion) was not on par with the 3rd gen speaker. I ordered this as a gift for my cousin, and they had no issues with the speaker except that it was pretty wobbly at times.To be fair though, they had a child in the house. I‚Äôve heard google home is better than Alexa in terms of software and answering skills, and other features. If you do plan on getting Alexa, I‚Äôd still recommend 3rd gen echo dots over 4th gen ones any day.",1
"This is a awsome device, just so needy in daily life can't even think, voice recognition is awsome, just whisper it will listen to u.Only disadvantage I feel is price, it should be little lower. Also speaker should be more watt so that at high volume there is anough clarity. Thanks Amazon for trying me this. I would like to use this forever",4.4
"Sound recognization is good.I found a problem with Bluetooth connectivity. I have tried to play some videos over the VLC which gives good quality of connectivity.1) Then I tried to play Some youtube videos while playing the video it stops and then continues sometimes. Even my Internet speed is good and connectivity is good. I suspect Alexa cant detect where to send data over Wifi/Bluetooth when the primary setting is on.2) If I have connected to multiple Bluetooth sources. I can use one source at a time. Alexa cant decide as to which source to be used as connectivity media(This has to be selected manually, But It could get connect automatically it would be a value-added feature). I have Bluetooth earphones and headphones which can automatically take a decision here.",5
Received the item today. Connected the Echo Dot as per instructions and got it working. Everything seems fine. Will give a detailed review after few days of using it.I have one complaint to make though. I ordered the item as gift pack but it came without any gift wrap. Not happy with Amazon service.,2
"Spotify service stopped working after the update. Unable to play any music. Though convenient for voice commands but have to setup again the echo device atleast once in a month. Sometimes don't respond properly, sometimes doesn't take commands, music service is not great to hear now. A great way has to be laid for good optimised and hassle free experience.",1
"Awesome productLoved it üòçüòç butThe new Echo came with improvements across the board in terms of sound quality, features, and design, the Echo Dot‚Äôs improvements are smaller. And in some cases, it‚Äôs a regression from the prior model.Still, the 4th Gen Echo Dot remains an excellent budget smart speaker, even at its full price. And with Amazon‚Äôs near constant sales, you‚Äôll likely be able to get one for even less.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†Getting a refund on the device, will miss the good times of Alexa definitely.",4
"Sound quality isn‚Äôt that great. Other than that the physical quality and the appearance is nice. I am not sure about the pricing as I never compared it with anything else. All in all good product, would have been great had the sound quality been different (better). Though my kids are enjoying the product.",4
"The sound system works well and the quality of audio is good for music in a small 3m x 3m room. The downside is the device doesn‚Äôt pick audio well. Many a time I‚Äôve had to repeat the wake word for it to pick my voice command. If I have to stop whatever I‚Äôm doing, turn towards the device and repeat my voice command, that defeats the purpose of the device.",5
A lot of features are not available in india. One of the main features that I noticed that was missing was the memory function. You can't ask alexa to remember that you kept your keys in the drawer. So that's a bummer. No different voice profiles. Sometimes there's a delayed response. But that's okay.,2
Very good Product...Sound Quality is just Amazing....this is a perfect echo dot as a Speaker üîài have also purchased wipro smart tubelight and Amazon Smart plug and I‚Äôve attached it to TV....and now my living room is totally Smart to amaze my friends‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èMust buy product....Loved itüíñüíñüíñüíñ,1
First of all I watched so many unboxing videos and got confused as in most of them were saying bass is not that good...but when I purchased it and tetsed the sound...I found few things..>>It has superb BASS at low volume and high volume.>>Vocals are also at its best.>>Liked the shape...Voice recognition also works like a charm if you have a decent wifi...,5
"Not a great product specially when it is created by Amazon 6 years ago. While every small equipment has rechargeable feature, how can this has to be always plugged in!! Sound quality is really pathetic. Made it for listening to news and Alexa and not music. Returning it to purchase better Bluetooth speaker which doesn't have AI but I can make it work better than a robot.",4
It good but if it is have a batery than it is world best speaker and sound quality of echo dot is very low as compared to its size like many other speaker like UE WONDERBOOM have same size and sound quality is so good but echo dot dont have loud sound quality,4
I have using eco dot 3rd generation and it is best quality product rather then this one.Charger quality is very low and no  branding over charger. Eco dot 3 charger have branding and log length wireSound not good as advertised as equal to 3rd generation,4
"I love the way Alexa converses and you can literally talk to Alexa as if you are speaking to a person. There are some limitations though, but it is expected as this is a technological device. Overall I would recommend everyone to have atleast 1 Amazon Echo (any generation) in your house. The sound quality could have been a little better, but this works too.",5
"worthless product since it is extremely unresponsive. in fact it is a headache it being unresponsive when you need to power on ,switch on some thing and thus  finally  you need to get up yourself to do that job for which you bought this nonsense of a product . sheer waste of your hard earned money",4.4
"i have my first smart speaker in the form of Eco Dot 4th Gen. it has good looks, sound quality and easy to use featers. It would have been a fantastic instrument,  if it had USB charging port like smart phones that would have facilitated use of Power Bank.",5
"I was using google home since it was launched couple years ago, yes I'm new to echo devices and never experienced previous generations, but this 4th gen is better than my Google home in every factors, delivered in 3 days, and alexa app is so much useful.",2
The bass is pretty low when in default settings but increases when you go to alexa app and increase the bass all the way to 5 and it gives it a good bass.thus it is configurable.you can even change midrange and treble in the alexa app.go to you devices choose the device select audio settings and you can find it,2
Has a good sound for such a small speaker. I already have an Echo and wanted this to supplement music in another room. Its a fantastic buy and the offer was too good to refuse!,4
I am really happy for the product even my family too. It covers everything you need in your day to day life. I hav been using bow for one week. The things like speech recognition in this technology(Alexa 4th Generation) is highly appreciated. You must buy this.Only one thing which bothers is you need a really good internet/wi-fi connection or else it buffers a lot.Now this is a honest review of one week. Enjoy and relax with Alexa 4th Generation!!!..,4
"Sound Quality, Thickness and Sheerness are all good and crisp. Wanted to have The Echo since a long time and finally bought this 4th Generation Echo as a gift for my daughter for her birthday, and she's very elated and happy with Alexa. Thank you Amazon but can you please manufacture these products in India itself..",4
"I was really looking forward to receiving this, but the stainless cup to put tea in has REALLY SHARP edges and I got cut right off. I dropped it while washing and it shattered so cheap, not Pyrex level glass, it only fell a few inches. So it was  a TOTAL WASTE of money, buy a nice ceramic one, this one is fancy crap.",4.1
"Strength of the tea can be seen in glass tea pot. AS the tea is infused in restricted space, an extra spoon of tea may be added if you like strong tea. The strainer fits nicely in a mug so can be used for making loose green tea, Octavius provide two 100 gm sample packets of their excellent loose green teas. Their green teas are highly recommended, especially Kashmiri Kahwa and cinnamon-Anise",4
It's worth the money paid .. looks classy and does its job perfectly. Loved it,1
500 ml will serve only one tea lover. Price high for this capacity. Other wise product finish is OK.,1
"Very simple to use. convenient and hassle free just pour water and powder of your choice and keep it on stove decoction is ready in minutes. Pour it into cup mix sugar, milk etc. Quality is also good.",5
Very classy and easy to use. The box keeps it protected and I love using it.,5
"Brought it some fortnight ago and used for making dark tea as I'm a sugar patient, and enjoying every sip. Though it's time taking to make a nice tea by microwave and the octavious pot, but after makinga fabulous tea one can enjoy its taste.",5
"It's a very classy design and very easy to use, the lid is sturdy and doesn't come out when you pour the tea in your cup.  It is microwave friendly and can quickly warm the tea without any problem. It also saves a lot of time from straining the tea leaves.",3
Quality of infuser material poor. Gauge of steel used is very thin.Poor packing.Also costly compare to other options available.,5
Kettle looks smart and works well. You however need a minimum quantity of water (two cups) for the leaves to come in contact with the water.The cap lock is flimsy and tends to fall off while you are pouring the tea.,5
Please dont buy this it's not worth for money moreover light weight it's 200 rs worth selling for this cost they cheated in photo it appears nice but the real one is very poor quality,5
Excellent design. Excellent pouring action. Ideal for 4 small cups (roughly 180ml each)of tea.,5
Good finish very useful. Our experience of having team improved lot. I wish i would have taken the 1ltr one. This can have 3 cups ..4 is upto the brim and difficult to manage.,5
"It‚Äôs pretty, easy to use and clean. A bit expensive but worth the usage. Looks pretty when tea starts brewing to show colour",5

"For Men who are facing hair fall issues its a Boon. Hair fall is frustrating, I am writing this review after one month of continuous usage, it is a better product as compared to other chemical compositions available. You have to be a little patient with the result, and you will notice it does what it says. BRINGHA, NEEM are scientifically proven to improve hair health and stimulates new growth.Additional Tips: Drink a lot of water, cure your stomach if you have digestion issues, get proper sleep, do a conditioner every alternate day and most important replace your old combs with wooden bristle brush or comb. It's tried and tested do it regularly and you will get the desired result in 30 days. Thank You its a great day. :)",4.2
"Why is it so hyped? I noticed no difference in my hair. In fact, I think my hair fall increased after using it. Didn't like this product one bit. Won't buy it again in near future.",5
"Hair related issues are quite common nowadays. Every other person is having some, be it greying, hair fall, dandruff, etc. We can't cure it all fully, but at least control it to some extent by inculcating good habits and routines, avoiding unhealthy food and going natural wherever possible.With the same idea, i gave up conditioners long ago and then ditched chemical-based shampoo a year ago. One day herbal/natural shampoo idea came to mind, as soap was not suiting at all.The search spanned across days, with several options like Khadi Mayuri, Himalaya, Wow, Biotique, etc. Many options. Huh. Some costly, some had a lot of -ve reviews, while some had few chemical ingredients. Considering all factors, narrowed down the search to Indulekha, which turned out to be a product by HUL (a renowned reliable company).‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INBOX‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Came without any box, with a tape to seal its cap and prevent accidental leakage.‚ñ∂ Colour: Dark brown‚ñ∂ Smell: Like Dabur red toothpaste (which is expected of ingredients in there i.e. ayurvedic smell)‚ñ∂ Stock: 02/2019‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INGREDIENTS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Bhringraj, Amla, Tulsi, Neem, Madhyantika, Shikakai, RosemaryEvery ingredient is carefully chosen & have health benefits for hair. Just google them.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢PROS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Nice smelling no-nonsense herbal shampoo for hair.2. Mild shampoo3. Produces good lather for small quantity.4. Reduces hair fall & dandruff. (see below)5. No artificial color or fragrance.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. The smell could have been better. It may not suit everyone.2. As is with every herbal shampoo, it makes your hair dry but to some extent only (as neem acts as a moisturizer). You may use an addon natural conditioner or oil to overcome this issue if its there.Since cons are subjective, they won't have any effect on my ratings. So a 5-star product.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢USAGE INSTRUCTIONS  & TIPS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Here i will detail my usage pattern, which is working well. Its been 2 months + since i started using it. I had issues of heavy dandruff since start & hair fall after a mistake of using chemical-based conditioners. Before that, there was no hair fall at all.The conditioner was ditched a half a decade ago and chemical-based shampoo a year ago. I settled on the soap for hair cleansing which again was a bad idea.‚ñ∂ Pre usage scenario:‚Üí Soap for cleansing‚Üí Hair oil once or twice a week‚ñ∂ Current usage scenario:‚Üí Regular application ( every alternate day) of shampoo, onion juice, and coconut oil.‚ñ∂ STEPS1. Wash hair thoroughly with the shampoo. Quantity of shampoo will depend on hair volume and oil content.2. Dry hair & scalp using a towel.3. I leave it as such for some time to let the scalp breath.4. Now apply onion juice on scalp and leave it as such for half an hour.5. Wash it properly using only water.6. Dry hair & scalp using a towel.7. Once completely dry, apply warm coconut oil to scalp and hair.8. Repeat this every alternate day. (for ladies this may not be possible, so settle for what best suits you, bi-weekly at least)‚Üí You can do this all before sleeping, if not possible during day time.‚Üí For those who cannot afford to have oily hairs throughout the day, shampoo in the morning and onion juice + oil at night will also work.‚Üí Onion juice may not suit everyone. Please test before going regular with it. There are other alternatives as per hair & scalp. Just google it.‚ñ∂ WHY ONION: ""Onion's rich antibacterial properties help keep your scalp healthy and free of infection, promoting unhindered hair growth. These same properties also help control dandruff. Onion juice stimulates your scalp and improves the circulation of blood, resulting in its follicles that are well-nourished.""‚ñ∂ OVERALL BENEFITS: Reduced hair fall by huge margins & no dandruff at all. This implies more hair volume and new hair growth.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢GENUINITY‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Again, as i always say. Be proactive and research well before ordering from any seller to avoid fakes. Check seller ratings, Amazon fulfilled tag, etc.Not every seller here is there to dupe you. They too source material from retailers and wholesalers.And if you are unfortunate, contact Amazon with your issue. They may be able to help you out. But since this product is non-returnable due to its nature, be proactive and avoid troubles in the first place.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢So far this shampoo is suiting me well. So is highly recommended. But it may not suit everyone due to different hair types, eating habits and other issues. The best thing is to try it out and then decide for yourself.Don't expect wonders in a day. Give it time and be regular.I won't suggest any alternative right now, as i didn't find any issue with it. But you may try Wow shampoos as its no parabens no sulfate, apple cider vinegar-based shampoo which can prove helpful. It won't even dry out hairs like herbal shampoos, as apple cider vinegar is a very good natural conditioner. Keep costs in mind.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢IMP NOTE‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Üí If you are looking for a shampoo to cure all your hair problems, you are in the wrong place. This shampoo cant do it all alone. It's just one of means to healthy hair and scalp.‚Üí It's not an alternative to healthy food, good sleep, and water. Accompany this shampoo with healthy eating habits, good sleep of at least 6 hours, and plenty of water.",2
"I have been using this shampoo for last 6 months . Must be my 3 bottle .-Verdict-1. Mild shampoo , can be used for daily hair wash.2. Has no chemicals .3. Helps somewhat to reduce hair fall and dandruff.Me like many other customers rely on other people‚Äôs reveiw . I bought this shampoo by looking at reviews only . Thanks fellow customers. This was of great use.",5
"About the posted product -  The product arrived promptly within time bounds.The packaging was safe with ample air bags so as to avoid damage.The Shampoo was brand new only 3 weeks old manufacturing, as compared to year old ones in local shops.About the Shampoo itself - even though no research supports the positives of bhringraj but I still wanted to give it a go. have been using for almost 2 weeks now. In conjunction with indulekha oil it is working as advertised, the hair fall has not much reduced as the advised usage is for 4 months. I will update the review after 4 months of usage.",5
Worst horrible shampoo I have ever used. So much hair fall while shampooing and too strong camphor smell. Used it 3-4 times now and my hair has become very dry and frizzy. Totally unmanageable. Please don‚Äôt even try this shampoo once in ur hair it will be damaged permanently.,2
"Fragrance is great!Hair becomes soft after use, Can be trie9 Once...I've started using it, almost 1 week.I bought because it's Ayurvedic!",5
"I find it very good. Smells amazing. I prefer herbal products for my hair. And i had good experience, hairfall has been lesser after the use of indulekha but it doesn't give instant result, after 3 months i found good result. I use it on regular basis. Makes my hair  soft, and fragrant but doesn't gives much shine to hair. Doesn't give ur hair volume like other chemical based shampoo gives.  Dont expect much from this shampoo but definitely wont damage ur hair.",5
"Very effective shampoo for hair fall, it's totally ayurvedic product.... Reduce hair fall by 80% in just two wash",4
"I was always a fan of the Indulekha oil but the shampoo is even better ! It actually works for my hairfall and I love the earthy, natural colour",4
"It's a really good shampoo; after trying en number of products I've finally settled for this amazing one.I'm using it along with Indulekha hair oil so I'm extremely satisfied with the results.

Strongly recommend.",5
It's an awesome product. In love wid dis product. V.nice fragrance and hair fall reduced to the maximum. Worth buying...,1
"I'm using this product for 2-3 months now there's no big difference in my hair fall,But the texture of my hair has improved, it's more soft and manageable doesn't get fizzy.The main reason for buying this is that it claims to have all natural ingredients as it smells and feels more like an ayurvedic product.",5
"Good product..... And after using indulekha for couple  weeks, new hair has been grown up....woao...... But should be careful to keep clean scalp regularly and should have to stop other product except indulekha.Friends you have keep healthy your internal parts of body also...like good metabolism, good immunal power.... simluteniously keep eating healthly foods also....then the hair oil can helps to reduce hair fall problem.Thanks Amazon",5
"Good shampoo. Smells like real Ayurvedic product. I had ordered after using this from another site due to less price but i found that product duplicate. It was thinn. So viewers, i want to suggest you buy on Amazon. Original shampoo is very thick. Coin size amount is enough For non-oiled medium length hair. Also check the bottle color (its golden yellow) whatever i got from another site was not like what i got here. So beware.. And purchase here.",4
Brought this as I was searching for parabens free products. But not sure if its free of it or not.The scent is good but the shampoo makes hair too much dried if you wash without oil. Conditioner is a must after using this shampoo.I would not be buying again,5
First thing first! - Checked hairfall it reduced! I got a sample of this product from one of the super markets which made me buy this bottle! As it says it's Ayurvedic.Pros:Smell is great! I loved it!Texture and colour is simply outstanding.Hairfall controlledHair looks nice after apying this.Cons:-Go for it!,5
"I was really amazed to see mind blowing rating and reviews and everyone claiming that this will not impact or doesnot have a side effect...but it turned out completely opposite.My hairfall is severe and extreme since ever after using this shampoo. Not just during wash but everytime i touch my hairs, it has patch of hairs falling down right from the scalp.Worst ever shampoo.",4.2
"Indulekha Bringha Anti-Hairfall Shampoo is like an ayurvedic medicine for hair fall. It has medicinal properties due to Extracts from Bhringraj plant which aid the skin with revival and regeneration of new hair.

It helped me to Reduce Hair fall, Doctor, Works for all hair types, no added fragrance and color or features that work for you and your hair.Give it a try and I am sure you will love it too.",5
"Well to begin with, this product does work. It‚Äôs been more than 3 weeks since I am using it. I wash my hair thrice a week. I was facing hairfall issue since last 4 months and I have been to dermatologist as well and tried medicated shampoo too. So when  I came across indulekha shampoo I thought of giving it try too. Here  I would go step wise:1 wash- obviously no product works wonders in 1st instance. Likewise no big difference in first wash. Although hair felt softer n nice to touch.2 wash - well I would say again I could notice that lumps of hair didn‚Äôt come out while washing but yes apart from that no change.3 wash- now here comes surprise , very few hair strands while combing after hair wash.From 4 th wash I started using oil also and yes it worked for me.Few points I would like to mention:Since all ingredients used are natural so u can be assured n can use it thrice weekly.Few people may find its smell strong but I liked it... it‚Äôs more like that of a camphor . But since I m ok with camphor smell so it was not an issue with me.Always remember: no product starts working from day 1 , you have to be patient with it.For best result use oil along with the shampoo.",3
"With so many chemical products in the market that claim to nourish and rejuvenate hair , it‚Äôs a deep relief to see Ayurvedic products that not only have the goodness of all the herbs but also helps revive that dull looking tress. After having used their hair oil, this was on my list from a long time and finally ditching those harsh shampoos laid my hands on this. The result so far is promising, my hair looks nice and fresh, adding that extra volume, doesn‚Äôt have a bad after smell and looks so presentable. Will definitely recommend this for people who have dry, frizzy and find it hard to maintain their hair üëç",5
Recently started using this shampoo after researching online about herbal shampoo available. Once suggested by my neibhours also who swear by this and trust me this shampoo worked wonder for me. You have to keep patience as it is herbal shampoo but after 2-3 wash my hairfall was drastically reduced and my hair started turning soft. Highly recommended for those who want to control there hair fall problem. Trust me you won't regret it,3

"I have been facing hairfall for a long time now due to hypothyroidism and have tried many products with not much help. My newest trial is with Indulekha Bringha Anti Hair fall shampoo. Natural ingredients like Bringraj, one of the recommended Ayurvedic treatments for hair fall, neem and no chemicals make this shampoo one of my preferred ones. Used this product for the last three weeks now, and must say hairfall is reduced. Smell is also not bad. Dries your hair if used without oil, so a little caution and this can be very helpful.",5

Thank u amazon for givinofferthisoffer.This shampoo stoped hairfall.Little shampoo is enough to wash hair. It smells very nice. Thank u indulekha...,5
"I ordered this shampoo as it is Ayurvedic and moreover I am already using Indulega Bhringa hair oil too. In combination, they both work quite well on my hair. This shampoo isn‚Äôt harsh on hair as it is purely herbal, sulphate and paraben-free. It also helped in reducing dandruff. It has no artificial fragrance and smells like any herbal product is supposed to be smelled! Though it does make hair a little dry, a conditioner afterwards takes care of it. Overall, a good and chemical-free choice.",4
Indulekha has already been a trusted brand for anti hairfall products and finally got hold of this shampoo and it didn't disappoint at all!The scent is bit like ayurvedic products for it's ingredients are all organic but still likeable.It comes in a pretty golden bottle and has all the instructions well featured on it.Most important thing is that it has definitely reduced my hairfall especially when I use it with the oil before washing my hairs.My hair feels more strong yet soft.Definitely a happy solution for healthy and soft tresses!,4
"After my pregnancy i was suffering from hair fall.I lost lots of hairs every day. My mother advised me to apply mehandi with amala and shikakai past. But it was so cumbersome job that i cant afford it then my neighbour told me about Indulekha Bringha hairfall shampoo.I also tried other chamical products earlier but it didn't worked,so i was not very much interested to use this also. But my neighbour insists me that I should try it atleast once.so I buy this and used it and you don't believe I really liked this product because my hairfall reduced gradually. It is a Ayurvedic shampoo with seven herbs and no side effects.It is also good hair cleaner at affordable price.",4
"So it's been some time since I have switched to indulekha anti hair fall shampoo. Earlier I was using Indulekha Oil and found it pretty good so thought of replacing my regular shampoo. And I must say using its really good. The shampoo has the goodness of Neem,Amla, Shikakai which benefits your hair and with regular use you will see the difference. It is also recommended by dermatologist so it is completely safe and good for hair. I would suggest to use it along with the oil to get better results. I can feel the difference in texture and hair fall is less.",4
Hair fall has become a very common problem nowadays so I decided to use indulekha anti hair fall shampoo as this is not just a shampoo but is an Ayurvedic medicine for the hair.

I have used this shampoo two to three times and have seen little reduction in hair fall. Not complete reduction but it is relatively less than earlier. I hope this will completely stop my hair fall with regular usage. It has thick dark brown colour consistency, it has got herbal , camphor kind of smell. Little bit is enough to create enough froath and cleanses the scalp well.  Bottle is very sturdy and easy to carry while travelling as the shampoo is not going to leak. It leaves hair silky and flowy. It is economical also.  Will recommend it to all.",3

It has all the Ayurvedic ingredients making it apt for healthy hair and it's regular growth.",5
"I am exasperated. Why are people going gaga over this product? It's a below average shampoo. It cleans quite well, but the hairfall is hardly reduced. And it leaves your hair very dry, which leads to further hairfall.You MUST use a serum or conditioner with this.",4.2
"Well I am writing this review after using the product for almost 2 months now. I was loosing a lot of hair and changed several shampoos. I read online about a lot of shampoos curating hairfall. Indulekha had a decent review online but I decided to place a bet and I actually won. Not only my hairfall reduced but the natural shine came back. Though it roughens the texture of your hair, I use a conditioner with similar ingredients as that of the shampoo and I have got the result I wanted",5

"Bhringraj prevents hair loss,dandruff and graying. My mom used to say this quite often and for that she used to dry Bhringraj leaves. Then she used to put those dry leaves in the jar of coconut oil and put the jar under the sun for few days until the oil colour changed to light green. Then she used to massage the green oil on my scalp. Well this one was a lengthy process and frankly speaking it's not possible to follow this procedure in today's hectic life. When I bought this bottle it was like the readymade potion my mom used to prepare for me. Added advantage is the scent. It smells good and equally good on hair too. It reminds me of my childhood days.",3

I have been seeing ads for this product for the longest time and like any other women hair fall is my biggest problem and another one of my problem was constant sweating. So I took a chance and ordered for a bottle after trying so many brands I must say this has left me a little more satisfied then most. After my first hair wash I felt my hair cleaner and volumed definitely I know this isn't a miracle shampoo and instantly you hair doesn't stop falling but it's been a few days and I'm happy with the results my hair fall is getting a little better and as this is made of plants so the chemical harshness isn't there.

I've switched to lot of shampoo -loreal sunsilk garnier  dove and even pantene!!

Its value for money. I applied this indulekha bringha hair cleanser on my hair which is an ayurvedic proprietary medicine for hair fall and I feel very satisfied with the impact it had on my hair.,5
"Searching for the shampoo which is best for our hair is just like searching the Mango in the Mango garden. We all keep on trying different shampoo‚Äôs all the time. But results are negative, some shampoo suits our hair and some gives us a very adverse effect on our hair.This shampoo comes with the goodness of Ayurveda, containing a blend of powerful herbs.My ExperienceThe results of indulekha bringha oil have quite impressed me. Hence, I decide to buy their bringha shampoo. The formula is nice thick and removes all the dirt from the scalp.I dilute the shampoo first and then use it on my hairs. I don‚Äôt need much amount of shampoo to wash my hairs. The shampoo is able to remove all the dirt and impurities effectively in just one wash.Pros Of Indulekha Bringha Hair fall ShampooTravel-friendly.Good packaging.Cleanses my scalp well.Rinses off easily.No added fragrance or colour.Thick consistencyAfter regular use, I‚Äôd say it helps get rid of impurities and keep your scalp clean, promoting good scalp condition for new hair follicles to grow from.",4.2
"Wrost product....I will advise everyone don't buy this product. It's really disheartening that even after paying this much amount of money there is not a single percent improvement in my mom's hairfall. Instead of Indulekha use any simple hair oil, but don't go for this product. It will not help your hairfall. Both the products Indulekha Bringha Hairoil and Bringha Shampoo both are useless.",5
"The Indulekha hair cleanser is a great ayurvedic cleanser, containing a blend of powerful herbs,It helps get rid of impurities and keep your scalp clean, promoting good scalp condition for new hair follicles to grow from. Yet, I am not sure how effective it really is when it comes to controlling dandruff and growth of new hair.If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative shampoo that may bring good results over time, you might want to consider buying a 10 in 1 shampoo with active ingredients known for repairing damaged hair and strengthening it from its roots.",2
"Heard about this brand through so many mommy blogs and thought to try this out. Since nothing else was working on postpartum hairfall, I bought this ayurvedic remedy and tried it, after second wash itself it started showing effects, now I see less hair strands on my bathroom floor and comb. It really improved my hair texture, and it's so pocket friendly. It's ayurvedic, free from any colour and fragrance, so it won't harm you in any way.The only con is, it doesn't have nice and fancy fragrance, which in a way shows that it is chemical free.",4

Overall a good shampoo.",5
"Last year under the influence of some YouTubers I bought Wow skin science & Mama Earth shampoos and it completely ruined my hair.My hair started falling and nothing could stop it. To undo the damage, I started searching for more remedies on YT, ironic, right?Anyway when nothing helped me so I decided to consistently oil my hair and leave it over night and use a mild herbal shampoo to rinse it off.My roomie had this shampoo and she used it religiously. So I thought I‚Äôll give it a try.I leave coconut oil overnight on alternate days I wash my hair using this shampoo. It‚Äôs been 9 months of this routine now and my hair has never been better.It‚Äôs  shiny, soft, manageable and almost nil hair fall. I‚Äôd like to think coconut oil and shampoo, both helped equally. I am on my 4th bottle (I always order the biggest one), the current plan is to take this shampoo to my grave.Anyway try it yourself, be consistent and have patience. Hope this helps you :)I‚Äôm into herbal scents, so the scent doesn‚Äôt bother me, maybe if you‚Äôre allergic to fragrance, it might give you a headache cause it‚Äôs strong.",4.2

"Why is it so hyped? I noticed no difference in my hair. In fact, I think my hair fall increased after using it. Didn't like this product one bit. Won't buy it again in near future.",5
"Hair related issues are quite common nowadays. Every other person is having some, be it greying, hair fall, dandruff, etc. We can't cure it all fully, but at least control it to some extent by inculcating good habits and routines, avoiding unhealthy food and going natural wherever possible.With the same idea, i gave up conditioners long ago and then ditched chemical-based shampoo a year ago. One day herbal/natural shampoo idea came to mind, as soap was not suiting at all.The search spanned across days, with several options like Khadi Mayuri, Himalaya, Wow, Biotique, etc. Many options. Huh. Some costly, some had a lot of -ve reviews, while some had few chemical ingredients. Considering all factors, narrowed down the search to Indulekha, which turned out to be a product by HUL (a renowned reliable company).‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INBOX‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Came without any box, with a tape to seal its cap and prevent accidental leakage.‚ñ∂ Colour: Dark brown‚ñ∂ Smell: Like Dabur red toothpaste (which is expected of ingredients in there i.e. ayurvedic smell)‚ñ∂ Stock: 02/2019‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INGREDIENTS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Bhringraj, Amla, Tulsi, Neem, Madhyantika, Shikakai, RosemaryEvery ingredient is carefully chosen & have health benefits for hair. Just google them.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢PROS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Nice smelling no-nonsense herbal shampoo for hair.2. Mild shampoo3. Produces good lather for small quantity.4. Reduces hair fall & dandruff. (see below)5. No artificial color or fragrance.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. The smell could have been better. It may not suit everyone.2. As is with every herbal shampoo, it makes your hair dry but to some extent only (as neem acts as a moisturizer). You may use an addon natural conditioner or oil to overcome this issue if its there.Since cons are subjective, they won't have any effect on my ratings. So a 5-star product.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢USAGE INSTRUCTIONS  & TIPS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Here i will detail my usage pattern, which is working well. Its been 2 months + since i started using it. I had issues of heavy dandruff since start & hair fall after a mistake of using chemical-based conditioners. Before that, there was no hair fall at all.The conditioner was ditched a half a decade ago and chemical-based shampoo a year ago. I settled on the soap for hair cleansing which again was a bad idea.‚ñ∂ Pre usage scenario:‚Üí Soap for cleansing‚Üí Hair oil once or twice a week‚ñ∂ Current usage scenario:‚Üí Regular application ( every alternate day) of shampoo, onion juice, and coconut oil.‚ñ∂ STEPS1. Wash hair thoroughly with the shampoo. Quantity of shampoo will depend on hair volume and oil content.2. Dry hair & scalp using a towel.3. I leave it as such for some time to let the scalp breath.4. Now apply onion juice on scalp and leave it as such for half an hour.5. Wash it properly using only water.6. Dry hair & scalp using a towel.7. Once completely dry, apply warm coconut oil to scalp and hair.8. Repeat this every alternate day. (for ladies this may not be possible, so settle for what best suits you, bi-weekly at least)‚Üí You can do this all before sleeping, if not possible during day time.‚Üí For those who cannot afford to have oily hairs throughout the day, shampoo in the morning and onion juice + oil at night will also work.‚Üí Onion juice may not suit everyone. Please test before going regular with it. There are other alternatives as per hair & scalp. Just google it.‚ñ∂ WHY ONION: ""Onion's rich antibacterial properties help keep your scalp healthy and free of infection, promoting unhindered hair growth. These same properties also help control dandruff. Onion juice stimulates your scalp and improves the circulation of blood, resulting in its follicles that are well-nourished.""‚ñ∂ OVERALL BENEFITS: Reduced hair fall by huge margins & no dandruff at all.

So is highly recommended. But it may not suit everyone due to different hair types, eating habits and other issues. The best thing is to try it out and then decide for yourself.Don't expect wonders in a day. Give it time and be regular.I won't suggest any alternative right now, as i didn't find any issue with it. But you may try Wow shampoos as its no parabens no sulfate, apple cider vinegar-based shampoo which can prove helpful. It won't even dry out hairs like herbal shampoos, as apple cider vinegar is a very good natural conditioner.

Accompany this shampoo with healthy eating habits, good sleep of at least 6 hours, and plenty of water.",1

Helps somewhat to reduce hair fall and dandruff.Me like many other customers rely on other people‚Äôs reveiw . I bought this shampoo by looking at reviews only . Thanks fellow customers. This was of great use.",1
"About the posted product -  The product arrived promptly within time bounds.The packaging was safe with ample air bags so as to avoid damage.The Shampoo was brand new only 3 weeks old manufacturing, as compared to year old ones in local shops.About the Shampoo itself - even though no research supports the positives of bhringraj but I still wanted to give it a go. have been using for almost 2 weeks now. In conjunction with indulekha oil it is working as advertised, the hair fall has not much reduced as the advised usage is for 4 months. I will update the review after 4 months of usage.",1
Worst horrible shampoo I have ever used. So much hair fall while shampooing and too strong camphor smell. Used it 3-4 times now and my hair has become very dry and frizzy. Totally unmanageable. Please don‚Äôt even try this shampoo once in ur hair it will be damaged permanently.,1
"Fragrance is great!Hair becomes soft after use, Can be trie9 Once...I've started using it, almost 1 week.I bought because it's Ayurvedic!",5
"I find it very good. Smells amazing. I prefer herbal products for my hair. And i had good experience, hairfall has been lesser after the use of indulekha but it doesn't give instant result, after 3 months i found good result. I use it on regular basis. Makes my hair  soft, and fragrant but doesn't gives much shine to hair. Doesn't give ur hair volume like other chemical based shampoo gives.  Dont expect much from this shampoo but definitely wont damage ur hair.",3
"Very effective shampoo for hair fall, it's totally ayurvedic product.... Reduce hair fall by 80% in just two wash",5

"I'm using this product for 2-3 months now there's no big difference in my hair fall,But the texture of my hair has improved, it's more soft and manageable doesn't get fizzy.The main reason for buying this is that it claims to have all natural ingredients as it smells and feels more like an ayurvedic product.",1

"Good shampoo. Smells like real Ayurvedic product. I had ordered after using this from another site due to less price but i found that product duplicate. It was thinn. So viewers, i want to suggest you buy on Amazon. Original shampoo is very thick. Coin size amount is enough For non-oiled medium length hair. Also check the bottle color (its golden yellow) whatever i got from another site was not like what i got here. So beware.. And purchase here.",4
Brought this as I was searching for parabens free products. But not sure if its free of it or not.The scent is good but the shampoo makes hair too much dried if you wash without oil. Conditioner is a must after using this shampoo.I would not be buying again,4
First thing first! - Checked hairfall it reduced! I got a sample of this product from one of the super markets which made me buy this bottle! As it says it's Ayurvedic.Pros:Smell is great! I loved it!Texture and colour is simply outstanding.Hairfall controlledHair looks nice after apying this.Cons:-Go for it!,4
"I was really amazed to see mind blowing rating and reviews and everyone claiming that this will not impact or doesnot have a side effect...but it turned out completely opposite.My hairfall is severe and extreme since ever after using this shampoo. Not just during wash but everytime i touch my hairs, it has patch of hairs falling down right from the scalp.Worst ever shampoo.",4.1

"Well to begin with, this product does work. It‚Äôs been more than 3 weeks since I am using it. I wash my hair thrice a week. I was facing hairfall issue since last 4 months and I have been to dermatologist as well and tried medicated shampoo too. So when  I came across indulekha shampoo I thought of giving it try too. Here  I would go step wise:1 wash- obviously no product works wonders in 1st instance. Likewise no big difference in first wash. Although hair felt softer n nice to touch.2 wash - well I would say again I could notice that lumps of hair didn‚Äôt come out while washing but yes apart from that no change.3 wash- now here comes surprise , very few hair strands while combing after hair wash.From 4 th wash I started using oil also and yes it worked for me.Few points I would like to mention:Since all ingredients used are natural so u can be assured n can use it thrice weekly.Few people may find its smell strong but I liked it... it‚Äôs more like that of a camphor . But since I m ok with camphor smell so it was not an issue with me.Always remember: no product starts working from day 1 , you have to be patient with it.For best result use oil along with the shampoo.",5
"With so many chemical products in the market that claim to nourish and rejuvenate hair , it‚Äôs a deep relief to see Ayurvedic products that not only have the goodness of all the herbs but also helps revive that dull looking tress. After having used their hair oil, this was on my list from a long time and finally ditching those harsh shampoos laid my hands on this. The result so far is promising, my hair looks nice and fresh, adding that extra volume, doesn‚Äôt have a bad after smell and looks so presentable. Will definitely recommend this for people who have dry, frizzy and find it hard to maintain their hair üëç",5
Recently started using this shampoo after researching online about herbal shampoo available. Once suggested by my neibhours also who swear by this and trust me this shampoo worked wonder for me. You have to keep patience as it is herbal shampoo but after 2-3 wash my hairfall was drastically reduced and my hair started turning soft. Highly recommended for those who want to control there hair fall problem. Trust me you won't regret it,5

"Hair related issues are quite common nowadays. Every other person is having some, be it graying, hair fall, dandruff, etc. We can't cure it all fully, but at least control it to some extent by inculcating good habits and routines, avoiding unhealthy food and going natural wherever possible.With the same idea, I gave up conditioners long ago and then ditched chemical-based shampoo a year ago. One day a herbal/natural shampoo idea came to mind, as soap was not suiting at all.The search spanned across days, with several options like Khadi Mayuri, Himalaya, Wow, Biotique, etc. Many options. Huh. Some costly, some had a lot of -ve reviews, while some had few chemical ingredients. Considering all factors, narrowed down the search to Indulekha, which turned out to be a product by HUL (a renowned reliable company).",5
Since 4 months i am continuously using indulekha hair oil but hairs were continuously shedding then i decided to use indulekha oil alongwith indulekha shampoo now frequency of shedding hairs have exponentially increased.Very cheap product don't know how other people have given positive note.I am quite  dejected as of now don't know what to do.,5
"Simple packaging, but benefits are extra ordinary, as I went for a wedding and used many hair styling products which led to dull dry hair with heavy hair fall.

Thank u amazon for givinofferthisoffer.This shampoo stoped hairfall.Little shampoo is enough to wash hair. It smells very nice. Thank u indulekha...,5
"I ordered this shampoo as it is Ayurvedic and moreover I am already using Indulega Bhringa hair oil too. In combination, they both work quite well on my hair. This shampoo isn‚Äôt harsh on hair as it is purely herbal, sulphate and paraben-free. It also helped in reducing dandruff. It has no artificial fragrance and smells like any herbal product is supposed to be smelled! Though it does make hair a little dry, a conditioner afterwards takes care of it. Overall, a good and chemical-free choice.",5
Indulekha has already been a trusted brand for anti hairfall products and finally got hold of this shampoo and it didn't disappoint at all!The scent is bit like ayurvedic products for it's ingredients are all organic but still likeable.It comes in a pretty golden bottle and has all the instructions well featured on it.Most important thing is that it has definitely reduced my hairfall especially when I use it with the oil before washing my hairs.My hair feels more strong yet soft.Definitely a happy solution for healthy and soft tresses!,4
"After my pregnancy i was suffering from hair fall.I lost lots of hairs every day. My mother advised me to apply mehandi with amala and shikakai past. But it was so cumbersome job that i cant afford it then my neighbour told me about Indulekha Bringha hairfall shampoo.I also tried other chamical products earlier but it didn't worked,so i was not very much interested to use this also. But my neighbour insists me that I should try it atleast once.so I buy this and used it and you don't believe I really liked this product because my hairfall reduced gradually. It is a Ayurvedic shampoo with seven herbs and no side effects.It is also good hair cleaner at affordable price.",4
"So it's been some time since I have switched to indulekha anti hair fall shampoo. Earlier I was using Indulekha Oil and found it pretty good so thought of replacing my regular shampoo. And I must say using its really good. The shampoo has the goodness of Neem,Amla, Shikakai which benefits your hair and with regular use you will see the difference. It is also recommended by dermatologist so it is completely safe and good for hair. I would suggest to use it along with the oil to get better results. I can feel the difference in texture and hair fall is less.",5
Hair fall has become a very common problem nowadays so I decided to use indulekha anti hair fall shampoo as this is not just a shampoo but is an Ayurvedic medicine for the hair. It contains bringha shikakai and amla which help to strengthen the hair and helps it to grow. It does not contain any chemicals so the hair is safe from harmful and harsh chemicals which other shampoos contain.It has a natural smell.

"An ayurvedic concoction which is very good and cleanses the scalp very well. Made of bhringraj, amla , tulsi, shikakai, rosemary and many more. All these items are very good for hair and scalp. I have used this shampoo two to three times and have seen little reduction in hair fall. Not complete reduction but it is relatively less than earlier. I hope this will completely stop my hair fall with regular usage. It has thick dark brown colour consistency, it has got herbal , camphor kind of smell. Little bit is enough to create enough froath and cleanses the scalp well.  Bottle is very sturdy and easy to carry while travelling as the shampoo is not going to leak. It leaves hair silky and flowy. It is economical also.  Will recommend it to all.",4.1

"I am exasperated. Why are people going gaga over this product? It's a below average shampoo. It cleans quite well, but the hairfall is hardly reduced. And it leaves your hair very dry, which leads to further hairfall.You MUST use a serum or conditioner with this.",5
"Well I am writing this review after using the product for almost 2 months now. I was loosing a lot of hair and changed several shampoos. I read online about a lot of shampoos curating hairfall. Indulekha had a decent review online but I decided to place a bet and I actually won. Not only my hairfall reduced but the natural shine came back. Though it roughens the texture of your hair, I use a conditioner with similar ingredients as that of the shampoo and I have got the result I wanted",5

So many products with lot of chemicals almost everything I tried but after using Indulekha hair cleanser I think I was very convinced about the product.

"Bhringraj prevents hair loss,dandruff and graying. My mom used to say this quite often and for that she used to dry Bhringraj leaves. Then she used to put those dry leaves in the jar of coconut oil and put the jar under the sun for few days until the oil colour changed to light green. Then she used to massage the green oil on my scalp. Well this one was a lengthy process and frankly speaking it's not possible to follow this procedure in today's hectic life. When I bought this bottle it was like the readymade potion my mom used to prepare for me. Added advantage is the scent. It smells good and equally good on hair too. It reminds me of my childhood days.",5

It doesn't contain any harsh chemicals. It is a must buy product for all hair problems.",4

It has bhringraj, Tulsi, Neem, rosemary oil, shikakai and other potent herbs which gently clean the scalp without damaging the roots and shafts of hair. The scent of this product isjust like any other ayurvedic medicine, I must say you just need a spoon full for shampoo so its value for money too! My ayurvedic doctor said it's a good addition for hair care! My hairfall is reduced significantly!",4.1
I have been seeing ads for this product for the longest time and like any other women hair fall is my biggest problem and another one of my problem was constant sweating. So I took a chance and ordered for a bottle after trying so many brands I must say this has left me a little more satisfied then most. After my first hair wash I felt my hair cleaner and volumed definitely I know this isn't a miracle shampoo and instantly you hair doesn't stop falling but it's been a few days and I'm happy with the results my hair fall is getting a little better and as this is made of plants so the chemical harshness isn't there. Looking forward to using this for a longer period and for my girls too.,5

I've switched to lot of shampoo -loreal sunsilk garnier  dove and even pantene!! They claim to relieve hair loss and damage but I know that by now it's all hot air.All you women out there need to understand  that  No shampoo out there can resolve hair problems .But this shampoo has natural ingredients. its fragrance is good. Its value for money. I applied this indulekha bringha hair cleanser on my hair which is an ayurvedic proprietary medicine for hair fall and I feel very satisfied with the impact it had on my hair.,4.1
"Searching for the shampoo which is best for our hair is just like searching the Mango in the Mango garden. We all keep on trying different shampoo‚Äôs all the time. But results are negative, some shampoo suits our hair and some gives us a very adverse effect on our hair.This shampoo comes with the goodness of Ayurveda, containing a blend of powerful herbs.My ExperienceThe results of indulekha bringha oil have quite impressed me. Hence, I decide to buy their bringha shampoo. The formula is nice thick and removes all the dirt from the scalp.I dilute the shampoo first and then use it on my hairs. I don‚Äôt need much amount of shampoo to wash my hairs. The shampoo is able to remove all the dirt and impurities effectively in just one wash.Pros Of Indulekha Bringha Hair fall ShampooTravel-friendly.Good packaging.Cleanses my scalp well.Rinses off easily.No added fragrance or colour.Thick consistencyAfter regular use, I‚Äôd say it helps get rid of impurities and keep your scalp clean, promoting good scalp condition for new hair follicles to grow from.",5
"Wrost product....I will advise everyone don't buy this product. It's really disheartening that even after paying this much amount of money there is not a single percent improvement in my mom's hairfall. Instead of Indulekha use any simple hair oil, but don't go for this product. It will not help your hairfall. Both the products Indulekha Bringha Hairoil and Bringha Shampoo both are useless.",1
"The Indulekha hair cleanser is a great ayurvedic cleanser, containing a blend of powerful herbs,It helps get rid of impurities and keep your scalp clean, promoting good scalp condition for new hair follicles to grow from. Yet, I am not sure how effective it really is when it comes to controlling dandruff and growth of new hair.If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative shampoo that may bring good results over time, you might want to consider buying a 10 in 1 shampoo with active ingredients known for repairing damaged hair and strengthening it from its roots.",4.1
"Heard about this brand through so many mommy blogs and thought to try this out. Since nothing else was working on postpartum hairfall, I bought this ayurvedic remedy and tried it, after second wash itself it started showing effects, now I see less hair strands on my bathroom floor and comb. It really improved my hair texture, and it's so pocket friendly. It's ayurvedic, free from any colour and fragrance, so it won't harm you in any way.The only con is, it doesn't have nice and fancy fragrance, which in a way shows that it is chemical free.",5
